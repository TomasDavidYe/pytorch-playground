## About
A **Pytorch Playground** is a repository allowing people of various Machine Learning experience to conveniently run experiments and benchmark different models on specific datasets with strong visualisation capabilities

The idea is to provide a Python environment where a developer can easily define geometric datasets via analytical equations, run various models on top of these datasets, measure and visualize their performance and, finally, gain intuition for which models work in which situation.

## How to Use his Package
This package is organized as a sequence of interactive tutorials, each of which graphically demonstrates a certain phenomenon from Machine Learning.

Each section comes with text explanation, code samples and visualisation to aid you throughout your learning process. Feel free to go through the chapters 1 by 1 or use the table of contents to jump to the sections that are most relevant to you.

## How to contribute
If you have ideas on how to expand this work, I want to hear about them!
Even better if you want to write some code for this repository yourself. 
I am super down for collaboration, so please reach out if you are interested.
