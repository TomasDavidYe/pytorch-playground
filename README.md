## About
A **Pytorch Playground** is a repository allowing people of various Machine Learning experience to conveniently run experiments and benchmark different models on specific datasets with strong visualisation capabilities

The idea is to provide a Python environment where a developer can easily define geometric datasets via analytical equations, run various models on top of these datasets, measure and visualize their performance and, finally, gain intuition for which models work in which situation.
